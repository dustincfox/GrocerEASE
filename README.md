For the final project for Dev Bootcamp, my team and I set out to create an easy way to manage recipes and use them to create a weekly schedule as well as a grocery list that would be available anywhere on any device. 

The focus on this project was to use different technologies and an agile process in order to gain real world experience in creating a web app. We ended up using two APIs in a Ruby on Rails app with a LESS based bootstrap front end design.

#How to start this app

1. Clone the repo

Assume you have rails and a postgres server installed. 

On the command line, typ
     
    $bundle
    $rake db:create
    $rake db:migrate
    $rake db:seed
    $rails s

The server will start on localhost:3000

#Adding a card to Trello

The title is one of two formats:

    Feature: description of feature
    Bugfix: description of bugfix

Each issue must be a user story.  We use the following user story format:

    "As a <role>, I want <goal/desire> so that <benefit>"

For example,

    "As a developer, I want there to be a how to contribute section of the Readme, so that I know how to contribute to the project."


Each issue must also contain a description of what 'done' means for that feature or bugfix.  For example,

    "the 'how to contribute' section is complete when
       1. there is a specific outline of how one can claim units of work
       2. A descript of the preferred format for letting the other contributers know when you have claimed something.

Once you are done writing up the issue, feel free to claim it.
